I created this website to chronicle my journey as I develop the framework for a significant endeavor that, as of December 23rd, 2023, I've named 'Blight Bright Airways.' The primary purpose of this site is to hone my project management skills and to organize my thoughts, particularly those concerning the integration of information within systems.

I believe the most effective way to delve into these concepts is through the creation of interactive simulations. A recurring focus in my work is the four forces of flight, and I am intrigued by the computational demands of these algorithms when they are executed with a high level of detail. Additionally, I aim to incorporate weather systems and their effects into these forces within the simulation.

Beyond the technical aspects, this project is also driven by a deeper intuition: that a key element of great art lies in its ability to approximate reality through abstraction. Essentially, my goal is to construct a simulated reality that mirrors our objective world, yet allows for the exploration of ideas or quicker access to conceptual 'shortcuts'.
